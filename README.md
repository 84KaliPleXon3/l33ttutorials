You can find all my bash scripts I used while I played with my Raspberry PI and Linux.

### addBelkin.sh
This script will install the internet interface so the Wifi will work. Don't worry! It does make an interface backup file.

### deluge-reset-settings.py
This python script will reset the Torrent Deluge settings.

### fixKeyboard-l33ttutorials.sh
This bash script will fix the default keyboard key mapping so US keyboards work properly.
